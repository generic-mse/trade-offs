Laurie, thanks looks good. Minor comments:

1. Would be good to calculate net present value of the difference between the base case (counterfactual or without) and each policy (the with). This is the standard cost-benefit approach. 

2. Costs could be declined by say 2% per year to account for fishing power/productivity growth. Would cancel out when comparing base case/counterfactual and policy, but more realistic appearance.

3. In economics, when using days as effort this is a Leontief production function, means fixed proportions and that if there are two inputs, variable inputs represented by days and capital stock represented by vessel numbers, then days are a limiting input and capital stock is superfluous. This raises the question of whether fixed costs should be included. Another option is to take a weighted average, using costs, of days and vessel numbers as effort. I have found that measure of effort that includes days and vessel numbers gives a better working (in terms of fit, signs of coefficients, etc.) than simply days.

The example is albacore, so you will like that. "Technical Change and the Commons". It is a minority view, which is why I am so strident on this, but the model is indisputable and cannot be overturned. The journal is a top pure economics journal. The standard bioeconomics model excludes any type of technological change.

Shadow pricing is the standard cost-benefit way to account for the "socio" part of socio-economics.It also raises changes in technology/productivity/fishing power and that BMEY<BMSY for rent maximization but BMEY>BMSY when biodiversity and ecosystems are considered. This paper is called "Putting Economics into MEY".

It tries to engage in my mind Mark Maunder and Jim Thorsen, the two population biologists with whom I discuss changes in productivity/technology/fishing power (and maybe you as the third!?). We try to fit in productivity growth with standardization and time-varying matchability. Any comments would be most welcome.
